# Task 1
# Image Classification Project 🖼️🤖

## Task Overview:
This project is part of the internship at **Digital Bhem** in the **Artificial Intelligence** domain. The task focuses on **image classification** using a deep learning model trained on the **CIFAR-10** dataset. The goal of the project is to create a machine learning model that can classify 32x32 color images into 10 different categories. 📊✨

## Project Description:
The **CIFAR-10** dataset consists of 60,000 images, divided into 10 classes, such as airplanes ✈️, cars 🚗, and birds 🦅. In this project, I used **TensorFlow** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify these images. The model is trained in a **Google Colab** notebook for easy execution and accessibility. 📓💻

### Task Objectives:
- 🔄 Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- 🏗️ Build a CNN model for image classification.
- 📈 Train the model and evaluate its performance.
- 🔍 Visualize predictions on a few test images.

### Key Features:
- **Dataset:** CIFAR-10 (60,000 images, 10 classes)
- **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 🧠
- **Library Used:** TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib 📚
- **Platform:** Google Colab ☁️
- **Task:** Image Classification 📷
